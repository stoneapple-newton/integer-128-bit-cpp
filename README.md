# integer-128-bit-cpp
the v1 and v2 code is to construct a `uint128_t` with two `unsigned long long int` and got basic operators.
v2 have `read` and `write` to read and write the number in a `uint128_t`,`pow` and `factorial` functions with some bugs on the high `unsigned long long`.
v3 will fix these bugs.
